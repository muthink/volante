15. Changed uses of Hashtable to Dictionary<>
16. Introduce enum IndexType and use it instead of bool unique param to IDatabase.CreateIndex() methods
17. Remove bool IDatabase.SerializeTransientObjects property and act as it's always true

23. Fixed a bug in BlobImpl.Seek() when SeekOrigin.End is used

31. Fixed bug in BtreeMultiFieldIndex.Contains() for non-unique index where it would throw an exception
32. Fixed LinkImpl iterator to throw InvalidOperationException when reached end of sequence
33. Fixed ThickIndex DictionaryIterator to throw InvalidOperationException when accessing Key when reached end of sequence
34. Fixed TimeSeriesImpl.Contains() to not throw and exception if object not found
35. Fixed Reset() on TimeSeriesImpl enumerator

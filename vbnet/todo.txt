Things to do for c# version:

* make a 0.9 release

After 0.9:
* make a reference API from .xml extracted during build process (after 0.9?)
* code coverage for all index key types
* write docs on how to work on Volante codebase
* document projection
* test perf with SlimTune
* silverlight version
* wp7 versions
* "who uses Volante" section in docs
* benchmarks info
* figure out why guid tests fail in mono
* an example of persisted double-linked list
* re-implement BitIndexImp.cs using AltBtree
* implement MemFile : IFile which to use for tests that need database to be closed and re-opened (and currently use file on disk for that)
* benchmark Bytes.unpack*() using unsafe fixed vs. bit fiddling
* benchmark using standard stream vs. compressed (gzip) stream for database file
* write a blog post about small size of Volante.dll (compare to e.g. log4net)
* make TestBlob verify both before closing and after closing database (?)

Ambitious projects:
* add integrated, small full-text search (maybe port FTS 
  from SQliteSharp but store indexes in NachoDB)
* add LINQ support

Notes:
* building without (old) Btree code saves 48kB (264 => 216)

Test coverage notes:
* 52%   on 2011-08-06
* 59.5% on 2011-08-24
* 61.4% on 2011-08-26
* 65.2% on 2011-09-08
* 67.5% on 2011-09-10
* 72.6% on 2011-09-13
* 74.9% on 2011-09-15
